# Healthcare Pricing Analysis Project
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital costs to aid employers in understanding healthcare pricing dynamics. Using private health plan claims data, this analysis provides an in-depth comparison of hospital prices at both facility and service line levels across various states.

## Project Scope
The analysis spans from January 22, 2024, to May 16, 2024, aiming to compile detailed reports on hospital spending and price comparisons to facilitate better decision-making for buyers supporting their staff's healthcare needs.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Initial Review: Started by familiarizing ourselves with the dataset to understand its structure and content.
* Cleaning Steps:
  * Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns to streamline the dataset.
  * Renamed columns for clarity and converted data types to ensure consistency and facilitate analysis.
* Preprocessing Outcome: Prepared a cleaned and structured Excel dataset ready for deeper analysis.
## Data Analysis
* Tools Used: Employed advanced data analytics tools to perform price calculation and trend analysis.
* Methodology:
  * Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and patterns.
  * Calculated standardized and relative hospital prices.
* Reporting: Drafted preliminary and final reports to document findings and insights clearly.
## Data Visualization
* Developed intuitive charts and graphs to illustrate spending trends and pricing patterns, making the data accessible and understandable for stakeholders.
* Visualizations focus on comparing healthcare costs across different service lines and states, highlighting significant discrepancies and trends.
## Final Deliverables
* Analytical Reports: Comprehensive reports detailing standardized prices, relative prices, and spending trends.
* Visualizations: A series of charts and graphs that visualize the analytical findings.
## Insights and Future Directions
* The analysis revealed a steady increase in average relative prices by 4.2% from 2016 to 2018, indicating a rise in healthcare expenses.
* Notable cost drivers included orthopedics and circulatory system services for inpatient care, and laparoscopic surgery along with CT/MRI for outpatient services.
* The project suggests a need for increased transparency and potential regulatory measures to manage healthcare costs effectively.
